# Encryption-Decryption-Code
This code is an encryption and decryption tool using a substitution cipher. It encrypts a paragraph by replacing each letter with a predefined character, adding random padding strings, and reversing the result. For decryption, it removes the padding, reverses the string, and substitutes characters back to the original.
